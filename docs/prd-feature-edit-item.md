# Product Requirements Document: Todo Item Editing Feature

## Product Overview
This document outlines the requirements for adding an edit functionality to the existing Todo List application. This feature will allow users to modify the title of existing todo items.

## Problem Statement
Currently, users can add, toggle completion status, and delete todo items, but cannot edit the content of existing items. This limitation forces users to delete and recreate items when they need to make changes, leading to a suboptimal user experience.

## Requirements and Features

### Functional Requirements
1. Users must be able to edit the title of any existing todo item
2. Users must be able to save the edited todo item
3. Users must be able to cancel an edit operation
4. The system must validate that edited todo items are not empty

### User Experience
1. Each todo item will have an "Edit" button alongside the existing toggle and delete buttons
2. Clicking "Edit" will transform the todo item into an editable form
3. The edit form will include "Save" and "Cancel" buttons
4. The edit form will focus on the input field automatically

## Technical Specifications

### Required Changes
1. **Model Layer**: No changes needed to the existing ToDoItem model
2. **API Layer**: Add new PUT endpoint for updating todo items
3. **Client Layer**: Modify the HTML/JavaScript in Program.cs to include edit functionality
4. **Validation**: Ensure edited todo items have non-empty titles (client and server-side)

### Implementation Details
1. Add `PUT /api/todos/{id}` endpoint to handle todo updates
2. Add an "Edit" button to each todo item in the HTML template
3. Implement JavaScript functions for inline editing (editTodo, saveTodo, cancelEdit)
4. Add client-side validation for empty titles before API calls
5. Add server-side validation in the PUT endpoint

## Success Metrics
1. Users can successfully edit and save todo items
2. Edit operations complete without errors
3. User interface remains intuitive and responsive
4. API responses are handled gracefully

## Implementation Plan
1. Add PUT endpoint in Program.cs for updating todo items
2. Update the HTML template to include Edit buttons and inline editing UI
3. Implement JavaScript functions for edit operations
4. Add validation on both client and server sides
5. Test the feature with various scenarios (valid edits, empty titles, API errors)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can click an "Edit" button on any todo item
2. Users can modify the title of the todo item inline
3. Users can save the changes via "Save" button, which persist in memory
4. Users can cancel the edit operation via "Cancel" button, reverting to the original title
5. The system prevents saving empty todo titles with validation feedback
6. Edit mode disables other todo operations until save/cancel is completed
7. API returns appropriate HTTP status codes for success/error scenarios
